Based on popularity of certain stock in a subreddit, predict the profitability of the stock based on price history through machine learning.

With wildly covered news of Gamestop(GME)'s stock "skyrocketting", jumping from mere 7 to 8 dollars a share to $450 at its peak, investors and traders are on the lookout for the next Gamestop. Even though it would be naive to think that Gamestop's case will repeat in the near future as the hedge funds will not be as bold like they were, revealing what their next move is and it is more than easy to monitor the reddit traders and their investment. Witnessing the interaction between the community board and the investment sector, I found a niche market where profit could be made, and they are pennystocks. With people doing their DD(Due Diligence) on the stocks they believe will soon rise in price and fellow traders jumping on board which results in hedge fund's hand participating to sharply raise the price(Pump) of the said stock and then dropping the price down near where it was in the beginning(Dump), pennystocks go through the so called Pump and Dump. The biggest danger of investing in pennystocks next to the stock going bankrupt, is getting on board when it is too late. But if you can be on board early enough, considerable profit could be made.
The best time to invest in these stocks are before or during the pump and then dumping with the big hedge funds.

The aim of my program is to find these pennystocks at the right time, purchasing before its rise or during its rise and then sell before it hits its peak. I will achieve this by doing the following:

1. Scraping the right subreddit(/r/pennystocks) for the next pennystock on the rise.
2. Building machine learning models that categorizes stocks based on the price history.
3. Using the built models, the stock's price history will be compared to the models to predict its profitability.
4. Automate trading through stock trading API.

Currently, Models have been created with small amount of data.
